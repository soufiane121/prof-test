        Driven full-stack developer with a diverse and ever-expanding set of skills. Eager to hit the ground running and use code to solve real-world problems and to learn new technologies. 
        Equally as comfortable diving deep into technology as I am client-facing or working with teammates. 
        Possess a strong people-first orientation with a commitment to professional ethics.
        Most recently I’ve been working on a project I wanted to implement for a long time by using and learning React Native. I enjoy playing soccer with my dog and when I first moved to the United States it was very hard for me to find people and places to play. Flatiron School gives me the opportunity to make people’s ideas became true,
         since coding for me is a way to create beautiful powerful things and share them with the world.<br />

         Skills/Interests: JavaScript, React, Redux, HTML, CSS, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Git, React Native

export default About;

// First things first, I like everything about computers, especially the fact that they are good at following instructions and mix between art and logic. It was fascinating to me since early childhood to see how computer works and how websites are designed in beautiful way . 
// I graduated from Flatiron School Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp, where I had a chance to learn tools for Full-Stack Web-Development, such as Ruby on Rails for Backend and JavaScript with React and Redux frameworks for Frontend. Studying at Flatiron School included a lot of collaboration with other students which I enjoyed since working on a team is a great opportunity to share your knowledge and learn from others.
